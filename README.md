How Authentication Works

• User creates an account on the Signup page  
• User data (email & password) is stored in browser Local Storage  
• On the Login page, entered data is matched with stored data  
• If data matches → login successful  
• If data doesn’t match → error shown  
• No backend or database is used (Front-end only system)
